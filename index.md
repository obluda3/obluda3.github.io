# Obluda

I'm Obluda (he/him), a 19 year old ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡² CS and math student, programmer & modder. And if you want to learn more about what I do, you've stepped in the right place.

I discovered **reverse engineering** in 2020 and it still remains one of the most fun things I've been taught. I've spent countless hours trying to learn how different features were implemented in games I enjoyed, and trying to implement my own ideas. 

Later in life, I developed an interest for theoretical computer science and its notion of **computation**. I hope to learn more about that in the following years.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/obluda3) or message me on Discord **@Obluda3**. ðŸ¤“ 

# Projects

Here's a list of different projects I've worked on.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Documentation

Over the past two years I've spent a lot of time **reverse engineering** Strikers 2013's code, data structures and file formats. 
[Here](/strikers) you'll find a **documentation** of the things that I (and other people) have learnt so far.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Xtreme

[Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Xtreme](https://www.xtreme13.com/) is a mod aiming to complete Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 by restoring its unused content in addition to some extra features. 

I was the **main developer** behind this mod. We started working on it in late 2020 (back then it didn't really have a name). It was released on *August 26 2022*.

The *extra features* were the results of the reverse engineering work I've done on this game. It includes a **music player/selector**, **random team generator**, **displaying hidden info** and stuff like that.

I'm extremely proud of that project, not only because of what I've learnt through it, but also thanks to the reception it got. Inazuma Eleven fans *loved* it. We even had a [World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAreqSNz67M) (really cool video, only in french sadly) with various countries across the world. 

[Here](https://github.com/obluda3/strikers2013-xtreme/)'s the main repository for the code I wrote. Sadly, a lot of it is hard to read as there are too few comments, and it's expected to know a lot about how the game works. Back then, I didn't know better...


## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 French Patch

I was one of the contributors behind the [french translation](/copa_project) of Strikers 2013. My job was to help with some text translation and graphics assets, but mostly to make tools to help modifying the game, with the help of a few others. 

We started the project back in **Summer 2020** when [Rosetta](https://twitter.com/fatalblooms92) managed to extract the game's files, but we were later joined by [AS](https://twitter.com/sltcas) who quickly became the lead of the project, and [Nayth](https://twitter.com/637nayth). 

In a way, this project was the start of my reverse engineering activities, and I'm really proud of what we've accomplished.

This has been my first ever completed big scale project, and we released it in **January 2023**.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 modding tools

I've made multiple tools to mod the game when I could've just made an *all-in-one*. Actually there's a reason but we'll save that story for another time...

### Strikers2013Editor

[Strikers2013Editor](https://github.com/obluda3/Strikers2013Editor) is used to modify **players**, **teams** and **moves** data structures in Strikers 2013. It also includes a save editor (although it's a bit uncomplete). I started to work on it in December 2020, and continued until 2023-ish.

### Strikers2013-Tools

[Strikers2013-Tools](https://github.com/obluda3/strikers2013-tools) is a program I initialy made for the french fan-translation project of the game. I made it in order to *import* files into the games' archives, back when available tools like [Kuriimu2](https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2) didn't support them. I also added support for the game's text format, and later re-implemented the game's compression algorithm.

## Street Football

Street Football is a video game based on the TV Show *Foot 2 Rue*. I worked a little bit on the game, for shitposting purposes...

[Here](/f2r)'s some stuff I wrote about the game's files. A full dump of the game's script is available in [English](/resources/f2r_eng.txt), [French](/resources/f2r_fr.txt) or [Italian](/resources/f2r_it.txt).

## Zorvex

Zorvex is an interpreted programming language that MrMotrix and I invented for a uni project. It's a basic imperative programming language, with no support for complex structure. Its syntax is inspired by common french pseudocode syntax.

[Here](https://github.com/MrMotrix/zorvex_projet_info)'s the repo for the project, along with the source code of the java interpreter.
