# Home

Hey I'm Obluda, a computer science and math student. This is my personal page, dedicated to display all the different projects I've worked in the past.

I discovered reverse engineering in 2020 and it became one of my main interests! I used to focus on learning how games were made, now I also try to implement new things in them.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/obluda3) or message me on Discord **@Obluda3**. ðŸ¤“ 
 
# Projects

Here you'll find many of my different video games **projects** for those that I reversed in the past.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Documentation

Over the past two years I've spent a lot of time **reverse engineering** Strikers 2013's code, data structures and file formats. 
[Here](/strikers) you'll find a **documentation** of the things that I (and other people) have learnt so far.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Xtreme

[Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 Xtreme](https://www.xtreme13.com/) is a mod aiming to complete the original game by restoring its unused content in addition to some extra features. 

I was the **main developer** behind this mod. We started working on it in **late 2020** (back then it didn't really have a name). It was released on *August 26 2022*.

These *extra features* were the results of the reverse engineering work I've done on this game. It includes a **music player/selector**, **random team generator**, **displaying hidden info** and stuff like that.

It uses [Kamek](https://github.com/Treeki/Kamek) by [Ninji](https://twitter.com/_ninji) to inject custom code into the game.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 French Patch

I was one of the contributors behind the [french translation](/copa_project) of Strikers 2013. My job was to help with some text translation and graphics assets, but mostly to make tools to help modifying the game, with the help of a few others. We started the project back in **Summer 2020** when [Rosetta](https://twitter.com/fatalblooms92) managed to extract the game's files, but we were later joined by [AS](https://twitter.com/sltcas) who quickly became the lead of the project, and [Nayth](https://twitter.com/637nayth). 

This has been my first ever completed big scale project, and we released it in **January 2023**.

## Inazuma Eleven GO Strikers 2013 modding tools

I've made multiple tools to mod the game when I could've just made an *all-in-one*. Actually there's a reason but we'll save that story for another time...

### Strikers2013Editor

[Strikers2013Editor](https://github.com/obluda3/Strikers2013Editor) is used to modify **players**, **teams** and **moves** data structures in Strikers 2013. It also includes a save editor (although it's a bit uncomplete).

### Strikers2013-teambuilder

[Strikers2013-teambuilder](https://github.com/obluda3/strikers2013-teambuilder) is the first program I made back in *December 2020*. It was used to generate teams using gecko codes. It was the first accessible way to add unused players to one's team.

### Strikers2013-Tools

[Strikers2013-Tools](https://github.com/obluda3/strikers2013-tools) is a program I initialy made for the french fan-translation project of the game. I made it in order to *import* files into the games' archives, back when available tools like [Kuriimu2](https://github.com/FanTranslatorsInternational/Kuriimu2) didn't support them. I also added support for the game's text format, and later re-implemented the game's compression algorithm.

## Street Football

Street Football is a video game based on the TV Show *Foot 2 Rue*. I worked a little bit on the game, for shitposting purposes...

[Here](/f2r.md)'s a documentation of the game's file formats. A full dump of the game's script is available in [English](/resources/f2r_eng.txt), [French](/resources/f2r_fr.txt) or [Italian](/resources/f2r_it.txt).

## Croaarc

[Croaarc](https://github.com/obluda3/Croaarc) is an archive extractor/packer that I made for **Webfoot** games. 
I quickly made it after figuring out the structure for the archive format used in them.
