f2r_01_intro:

-tag: It's quiet in Port Marie today, don't you think? 
-jeremy: Too quiet, Tag. I can't wait any longer. I want action! 
-jeremy: The federation should have already published the list of qualified teams! 
-tag: Have a bit of patience, Jeremy! We've never seen you as excited as you've been the last few days. 
-tag: In fact, ever since organisation of the street football world championships was announced! 
-jeremy: Ok, that makes sense now! You're the captain Tag, it's normal for you to stay calm. 
-jeremy: Me, on the other hand, I have the soul of an attacker! And itchy feet! 
-tag: You would do better to save your energy for our upcoming matches. 
-jeremy: Do you remember when we played the Apaches? We were three all. Brains dribbled... 
-jeremy: ...he passed the ball to me... I moved in front of the goalkeeper and... GOAL! 
-pradet: Oh look, the weenies! I've been looking for you. Get in the car, I've been told to take you to the Riffler Institute. 
-tag: It's bound to be for something important. Let's go! 
-tag: Samira, Brains, Eloise, there you are! 
-fede: We were expecting more than just you, Tag and Jeremy. 
-fede: I asked you here because I have some important news to tell you... 
-fede: The list of teams is ready at last, but... 
-fede: ...you still have one match to win to qualify. 
-fede: You'll be playing the Black Devils team. 
-tag: The Black Devils? Never heard of them... does anyone know? 
-tag: What about you, Fédé? 
-fede: I don't know any more about it than you, to my knowledge no one has seen them play yet. 
-fede: Besides they registered barely a week ago. 
-tag: By the way, when was the match scheduled for? 
-fede: It will be tonight. 
-equipe: Tonight? 
-jeremy: That's a joke right?! Why not the day before yesterday when we were there? 
-fede: Sorry, that was the only date they could do. 
-tag: Come on Rifflers... ready for a challenge? 
-equipe: Yeahhh! 
-tag: Right, training everyone! 
-tag: Is everyone sitting down? Good, let's begin. 
-estelle: Hey Rifflers! Are you ready for tonight? 
-tag: Estelle! 
-estelle: I heard about the match. I wondered if I come and train you? 
-tag: Your help is appreciated... really nice! 
-estelle: I owe you that much, it was you who taught me all about team spirit! 
-jeremy: That's fantastic, you are the best female player of all time! 
-estelle: You exaggerate... but you're not bad either, huh? 
-jeremy: Wow! It's not every day I get to train with such a pretty girl! 
-samira: Come again? 
-jeremy: Ahem... except when I train with you, Samira! 
-estelle: Ok, does that mean you need to practice some passes with me? 

f2r_02_intro:

-jeremy: Phew! That was tiring! And to think the match hasn't even started yet... 
-jeremy: Right friends, I suggest a break! 
-stephane: How long till the match? 
-tag: Stephen! You came all the way from your city just for us! 
-stephane: You must know the street football values, right? Sharing, friendship, solidarity! 
-stephane: Of course I'll support you. All the more so since I'm your number one fan! 
-stephane: Eloise, what do you think about a few shots? 
-eloise: Great idea, Stephen, you're a star! You'll see just what I can do... 
-tag: I'll shoot! 
-victoire: Hi friends. I hope I'm not disturbing anyone? 
-jeremy: Pfff... At Riffler, you even disturb the sparrows! 
-tag: Victoria! What are you doing here? 
-victoire: I wanted to see what your game was like... 
-victoire: We have every chance of being knocked out tonight. 
-victoire: With me on your team, you would be invincible! 
-jeremy: We don't need you here. Besides, you said it yourself, you're not part of the team! 
-jeremy: ...Because you have proved to us that when you play, it's not just about you. 
-tag: Right, excuse us Victoria, our training won't wait... 

f2r_03_intro:

-jeremy: Wow, we are on top form! Be very scared Black Devils, for today we'll be knocking you out! 
-tag: We just have to perfect our strikes now... 
-eloise: Tag, with me in goal you'll never score. 
-tag: We'll see about that! 

f2r_04_intro:

-fede: Well, well, Rifflers. Working hard I see! 
-fede: For your next lot of training, go to the General District. 
-fede: Someone is waiting there for you. 
-tag: Who? A pretty admirer? 
-fede: Maybe! Brains will be delighted... 
-gabriel: To the General District everyone! Quick! 
-fatou: Hey to my favourite team! Look who's here! 
-matt: Hi! I was told I could be of help... 
-equipe: Matt! 
-jeremy: How about an autograph Matt? 
-gabriel: Fa... Fatou, I knew you'd come! 
-eloise: Brains, close your mouth when faced with Lady Love! And Jeremy, stop behaving like a groupie! 
-tag: It's a great honour, Matt! 
-matt: Ah ah! "It's a great honour". 
-jeremy: So even football stars are coming to admire us now? 
-fatou: No, no, I wrote to him to ask him to come and give us some advice. 
-jeremy: Aha... 
-matt: She showed me some videos of your matches. You could qualify but you need to strengthen your defence... 
-fatou: I think so too! Brains, want to try getting the ball from me? 
-gabriel: Who me? Yes, I'd love to! 
-samira: Do not be distracted by her appearance! 

f2r_05_intro:

-zinguezinho: Ah ah ah ah ah! 
-tag: Wow, Zangazino! Did you watch us? What did you think of our game? 
-zinguezinho: Pretty good! But it's missing something... 
-jeremy: What then... A ball signed by Matt? 
-matt: Why not? But your attack could do with some improvement still. 
-tag: How so? 
-matt: Well... by playing Zanzagino! 
-zinguezinho: Yes, but which one of you is going to manage to get through my defence? 
-matt: That sound's like a challenge to me! Who's up for it? 
-samira: Me! Zangazino, time to teach you a lesson! 

f2r_06:

-fede: I came to see how it went. Matt, what did you think of them? 
-matt: Promising! They are raring to go, ready to give their all. No? 
-equipe: Yeahhh! 
-fede: Guys, time to get going... We have a qualifier to settle. 
-tag: The Black Devils... Let's do it, team! 
-fede: Welcome the last qualifier match for the Street Football World Championships! 
-fede: Thank you, Matt, for joining us today... 
-matt: I wouldn't have missed it for the world! 
-fede: Today, the famous Rifflers team... 
-fede: ... play against the Black Devils. 
-fede: The two teams are invited to make their way onto the pitch. 
-equipe: Huh? What? No way! 
-tag: Victoria? ... Aha, I should have guessed you would be behind all this! 
-victoire_sport: Let me introduce the amazing Black Devils. I set up the team myself. 
-tag: But... They're the best street football players in the world!? 
-victoire_sport: Thanks to my father, I flew them in from all four corners of the globe. 
-matt: That doesn't seem very fair to me! 
-victoire_sport: There's nothing against it in the rules... Today will mark the end of the Rifflers' reign! 
-fede: Ball to the Rifflers. OK, match starts on my whistle.

-victoire_sport: You got lucky, that's all. This won't be the end of the Black Devils! 
-matt: Don't worry about her. Whatever she does, you have something she will never have... 
-matt: Have you guessed what I'm talking about Tag? 
-tag: Yup... the street football spirit! 
-tag: Sharing, friendship, respect and solidarity. She can't do anything to beat that.

-matt: Young lady, your behaviour is deplorable! 
-gabriel: You're nothing but a cheat Victoria! You arranged everything in your favour as usual. 
-victoire_sport: Look at that. He's so cute when he's angry! 
-tag: Brains, they won. We have no problem with that. 
-matt: Spot on Tag. That has no place in street football spirit. 
-victoire_sport: Street football spirit! Ah ah ah! Thankfully ridicule won't kill you! 
-samira: What a surprise that you would say that. It's a state of mind you will never have. 
-tag: That's enough Victoria. Congratulations to you and your team. 
-victoire_sport: I like that better. 
-fede: Don't be discouraged kids. 
-matt: All the best teams go through difficult patches. You know I've seen my fair share of defeats too! 
-fede: ...it's just as much about accepting our failures as it is winning.
